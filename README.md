Welcome to our general Machine Learning template. Although the concepts here are directed for use with Python, this template was created through research and application using Python, R, Google TensorFlow, and AWS Machine Learning. Over time, this template will be updated to include additional information more strictly related to those other products and tools. Please keep in mind there is no guarantee for the accuracy or applicability of the information contained here. This is merely my vessel to encourage self-learning and exploration of the Machine Learning & Neural Network worlds.
