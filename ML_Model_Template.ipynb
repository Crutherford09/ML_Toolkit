    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to our general Machine Learning template. Although the concepts here are directed for use with Python, this template was \n",
    "created through research and application using Python, R, Google TensorFlow, and AWS Machine Learning. Over time, this template\n",
    "will be updated to include additional information more strictly related to those other products and tools. For now, we'll focus on Python. Please keep in mind there is no guarantee for the accuracy or applicability of the information contained here. This is merely my vessel to encourage self-learning and exploration of the Machine Learning & Neural Network worlds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should you find that this template is missing information, contains incorrect code, or could be impvroved- please don't hesitate to reach out at coddrutherford@gmail.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "Although this is meant to be a document worthy of introducing one to Machine Learning, there are a few assumptions made for those utilizing this notebook at this time- \n",
    "1. *You should understand the basic concepts of Statistics.* If you don't, then you can start by taking this course- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/business-statistics-analysis OR if you are capable of self management, https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=9FSVNPE1E3M9KS26EC5S.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. *You should know the basics of programming in Python (3.5+).* If you need to brush up on your skills, or are learning from scratch, I recommend CodeAcademy's course-https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python. Short, straightforward, and relatively fun.As for getting some hands-on time with Machine Learning prior to/during use of this notebook, the following course from Coursera looks great https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. *You should understand the concept and underlying meaning of the terms \"Machine Learning,\" \"Deep Learning,\" and \"Neural Networks.\"* Although this notebook is currently limited to Machine learning, this will change over time. A great started point is https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/ AND check out google's tensorflow to see what some of the future implications will be- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZikw5k_2FM.\n",
